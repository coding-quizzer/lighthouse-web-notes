## Function Rules
  1. Use Descriptive, action names for your functions 
  2. Use camelCase
  3. Use proper indentation
  4. Break functions into smaller tasks. As a general rule, each function should either change the environment or return a value, not both. simpler functions are generally easier to give names to.
  5. Avoid using global variables in your functions
